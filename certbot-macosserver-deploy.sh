VERSION="v1.05"

# NOTE: this script may remove identities that are related to the domain
# being installed/renewed (keys & certs) from the System keychain if the
# identity is no longer in use by Server.app. This is limited to identities
# that cover the domain name being updated/renewed only.
# It will thus remove identities that may be in use without Server.app being
# aware of them. DANGER! This may be unsafe on Mojave+ Server 5.7+ or in any
# situation where there are identities managed by certbot in use outside of
# Server.app's knowledge.
# Uncomment the next line to live dangerously (but useful if it applies to you):
MODE="REMOVE"
# Use at your own risk.

# This script should be executable and run as root

# Examples (all with force renewal, this is not normal usage):
# sudo certbot certonly --force-renewal \
#   --webroot -w /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/www.example.com \
#   -d www.example.com,foo.example.com \
#   --deploy-hook <LOCATIONOFTHISSCRIPT>/certbot-macosserver-deploy.sh
# Or install in directory /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy and:
# sudo certbot certonly --force-renewal \
#   --webroot -w /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/www.example.com \
#   -d www.example.com
# Or install anywhere else and (2 commands):
# sudo certbot certonly --force-renewal \
#   --webroot -w /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/www.example.com \
#   -d www.example.com
# <LOCATIONOFTHISSCRIPT>/certbot-macosserver-deploy.sh www.example.com

# Actual normal use:
# 1. Install as /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/certbot-macosserver-deploy.sh
#    and it will be automatically run by certbot after installation of a new cert
# 2. Run once by hand to install the cert the first time (example for two domains):
#        sudo certbot certonly \
#            --webroot -w /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/www.example.com \
#            -d www.example.com,foo.example.com
#    This installs the cert for the first time
# 3. Add a line to the root crontab, such as
#        10 5 * * * /usr/local/bin/certbot renew >>/var/log/certbot.log 2>&1
#    This keeps your cert valid. Renewal is logged in /var/log/certbot.log
#    (which technically will grow endlessly, so for perfection, this log file should be trimmed)

# The actual script starts here
